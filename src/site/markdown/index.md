# About MnConvention

MnConvention is a post-processor for reading the CSV generated from the BitForms containing registration information.  The registration information needs to be parsed to translate escaped characters and specific unicode characters from the array of selected seminars.  Ultimately, this will produce an Excel XLS file that can be read as an Excel Spreadsheet.
