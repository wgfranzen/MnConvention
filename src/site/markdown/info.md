## How It Works

MnConvention has a web site collecting registration information.  That information is periodically extracted to a csv file.
The csv file contains information about the registrant, their meal choice and their preferences for viewing seminars.  
There are three key interests in the information:

* The basic information about the registrant
* The meal choice, and counts of the different meal choices
* The seminar preferences, and the counts of possible attendance for a specific seminar to help determine room size

The MnConvention application reads the CSV file and creates an Excel workbook with four sheets:

* A Registration Detail sheet 
* A Seminar Detail sheet
* A Meals Summary sheet
* A Seminar Summary sheet

Since this is under development, we expect changes to occur.
